# Homework D1PP2014 description

- Dependencies:

    1. Jackson 1.9.9 - needed for json
    2. JUnit 4.1.1   - needed for parametrized tests
    3. Log4J         - needed for logging
    4. JFlex 1.4.3
    5. etf libraries

- Testing process workflow

    1. In parser specification file we need to mark messages which are generated
       when syntax and semantic errors occur.

    2. JSON file contains list of all possible grammar errors for every single
       test

    3. File "logs/testResult.log" contains parser output after single testing.
       File is actual test result, and grammar errors are pulled from it via
       regex into TestInfo java class.

    4. JUnit parameterized test compares list of value obtained from json file
       and list of values obtained from actual parser outputs.
